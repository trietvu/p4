This project is a Ledger or Checkbook App. It gives the user the ability to create
checking, savings, and credit card accounts.  

Additionally, it allows the user to create a user account, an account for each financial
account they hold as well as input transactions for each of their accounts. The app stores
the following data for each account: Account name, Account Type (Checking, Savings, or Credit
Card), the Account Number (last 4 digits only), the financial institution's phone number,
website, and the username for that account.

After login, the user is taken to their "My Accounts" page which lists all of their
financials accounts. Here, they're able to view all of their transactions, which include
the date of the transaction, the transaction name, category, amount, recipient, memo, and
receipt image upload.

The account transactions page also includes a balance for that account.  Checking and savings
accounts will have a positive amount for credits and deposits and a negative amount for
a debit transaction. Credit card accounts will have a positive amount for all purchases
and a negative amount for payments or credits to the account.

The Lity Lightbox plugin was used to show receipt images so that the user did not have
to load a new page and then go back to see the receipt. A reporting tool was the final
component that I would have liked to have included in this project but I ran out of time.

There were issues pulling data from three different tables for one user as each user would
have their own account(s) with many transactions but with the help of individuals on Piazza
and my section, I was given the insight to solve them on my own. Despite only really using
the One to Many database relationship, there were challenges to the project. Many thanks
again to my TA, Jennifer, members my section and classmates on Piazza for their help and
insight.
